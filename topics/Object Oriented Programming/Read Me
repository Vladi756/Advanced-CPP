This is the most integral part on your C++ learning journey. OOP is something that any software engineer who is serious about what they do needs to know. 

This folder will contain several C++ programs which will explain and illustrate various Objected Oriented Principles. Concepts such as: encapsulation, inheritance, structs, objects, classes, static and dynamic polymorphism will all be covered. I would highly recommend really spening some time to familiarize yourslef with all these topics as, again, this is the most important part of your C++ learning journey - so make sure to understand every topic before moving on to the next one.
